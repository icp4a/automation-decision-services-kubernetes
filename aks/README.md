## Ingress with nginx controller

Use [nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) to serve ADS ingresses to handle url rewriting.  
You can use basic installation [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/load-bal-ingress-c/create-unmanaged-ingress-controller?tabs=azure-cli#basic-configuration)

Then you'll use [ads-generate-ingresses.sh](../scripts/ads-generate-ingresses.sh) script with `-t` option to obtain the ingresses definition you'll have to apply to your cluster.  
This will generate ingresses with TLS termination done into nginx pods. 
By default certificates presented while accessing to https://cp-console.subdomain.my-company.com and https://ads-cpd.subdomain.my-company.com will be self signed and  generated by the certificate manager from the `zen-tls-issuer` Issuer.  
This behaviour is controlled by `cert-manager.io/issuer: zen-tls-issuer` annotation in ingress descriptor as described in https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/. 

```
$> ./ads-generate-ingresses.sh -n ads -t
# Checking prereqs ...
[âœ”] kubectl command available
[INFO] Writing kubernetes manifests to /tmp/tmp.5ztkofcnIU
$> kubectl apply -f /tmp/tmp.5ztkofcnIU
```
Create an _alias_ A record for `*.subdomain.my-company.com` to the load balancer plublic IP adress.
It can be obtained with
```
kubectl get service -n ingress-basic ingress-nginx-controller -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```
Then, https://ads-cpd.subdomain.my-company.com will be accessible.
